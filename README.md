# Rishav Chakravarty's personal website: [rishavc.me](http://rishavc.me)

## General
Try hovering over random elements! I tried to make the website as gooey and reactive as possible and feasible.

## Code
Check out my [Github page](https://github.com/rishavchakra) to see some of my work! It's currently a little sparse, but I plan to keep it better updated with my projects in the future.

## Art
See more of my artwork on my [Artstation portfolio](https://www.artstation.com/rishavchakra) and my [Instagram page](https://www.instagram.com/ribob_3d/)!

Hover over <u>3D Art Generalist</u>, <u>Illustrator</u>, and <u>Filmmaker</u> to see what they entail! 

### Software
I'm proficient with (in order shown) [Blender](https://blender.org), [Krita](https://krita.org), [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/), [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?promoid=RBS7NL7F&mv=other), [Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the [Jetbrains suite](https://www.jetbrains.com/).

## Work experience
I worked as an intern and research assistant at the ARL:UT apprenticeship program. Unfortunately, almost all of my work is classified or restricted, so I can't share specifics, but you can find out more about the program [here](https://wwwext.arlut.utexas.edu/se.shtml).

## Contact form
The contact form at the bottom of the page can be used to easily and instantly send me messages.

It is possible to send anonymous messages by not inserting a name, but the message field is required in order to send a message.

### NOTE:
In this version, all messages go directly into my personal inbox, and the mail transfer protocol service I'm using limits me to 300 emails a day. If I exceed this, either the service will shut down for the day or I will be billed. Please don't spam :)

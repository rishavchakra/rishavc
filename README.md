# Rishav's personal website

## Master branch

This is a new and partially unfinished website, built entirely in ReactJS. Styling is done with SASS/SCSS.

Future work: complete necessary content and styling and host as a website

### Home page

This page contains links to the other pages. Most content is shifted away from this page to other routes.

The contact form at the bottom sends an email to me.
The email code for this is unique but secure and untraceable.

Future work: 
- add necessary content to Code and Art sections
- fix screen-reactive layout

### Code page

This page contains Github API integration. It uses the Github REST api to fetch the project I worked on most recently, including its name, description, and the languages used to make it.

Future work: 
- Fill in necessary content and styling
- allow for more Github-related or social media actions
### Art page

This page currently only contains a Synthwave scene. This is built with ThreeJS (using react-three-fiber) and custom GLSL shaders for displacement and coloring.

Future work: 
- Fill in necessary content and styling
- Try to integrate Instagram API to fetch most current images (Instagram's API is hell â€“ I'll try my best)


## GH-pages branch

This is an outdated but fully functional and fleshed out website built with pure HTML and CSS with a couple of React components.

Future work: none (deprecated)
